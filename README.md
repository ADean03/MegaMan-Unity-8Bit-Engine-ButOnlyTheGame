# Unity MegaMan 8 Bit Engine


## Info
As the Blue Bomber doesn't get much love in Unity projects, I thought I would make a simple MegaMan project in Unity 2D and release it for everyone to use.

In this repository you can find the playable files by themselves, so you don't have to use or have Unity. Windows and Mac versions included.


## Open source

You can find the actual engine, completely open source, over here: https://github.com/MegaChibisX/MegaMan-Unity-8Bit-Engine
